      The “Pac-Man Resurrection: HIDE & SEEK” is a new edition to the beloved classical video game series, “Pac-Man.”
      The original “Pac-Man” game was a “game of tag” against the ghosts: running in the enclosed maze to collect all
      the “dots” to win the game while fleeing the pursuit of the ghost patrols. But, have you ever wished Pac-Man to
      have the ability to go invisible? To suddenly disappear, confuse the ghosts of your whereabouts, wait until they
      are gone, and continue your endeavor to collect all the dots? Then this is the game that made your wish come true!
      But wait, that’s not it. What if Pac-Man doesn't need to collect any dots? What if Pac-Man is wealthy of the dots,
      that he can simply score points by dropping them out from his own pocket? Yes. “Pac-Man Resurrection: HIDE & SEEK”
      resurrects Pac-Man with overpowered abilities of wealth and invisibility to troll and prank the ghost patrols! It
      is a simple game to give Pac-Man the opportunity to finally pay back the ghosts! The game has simple controls: use
      the “arrow keys” to control the Pac-Man and run away from the ghost patrols! Go invisible by letting go of the
      “arrow keys”. As long as you don't move, the ghosts will not be able to see you! The “enter key” allows you to
      drop Pac-Man’s dots from his pocket and score some points! Remember, Pac-Man only has 1000 dots in his pocket, if
      you hit those points on the scoreboard, you win the game! Unless you prefer to continue trolling the ghosts… Now
      go enjoy the game!</h1>
